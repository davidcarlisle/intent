### Notes

Level 1 here is sheet 1 (Level 1 Ed) of the original source

Sheet 4 (Level 1 CMML) could of course  be added

The conversion is currenly the most trivial possible to basic markdown
tables and styled with the default github pages styling with no theme
or custom style at all. Obviously more style and/or table sorting
opions could be added if we decide to use this at all.

The GitHub Wiki markdown doesn't seem to support markdown tables, so L3 is
declared to be `org mode`, which means that currently the table
`| a | b | c |`
syntax does work but linebreaks `<br>` and links `[text](url)` do not.
They could obviously be regenerated as org mode links if we decide to use his.
(`textsyle` and `creole` formats also work for wiki tables if we don't  want `org mode`.)

Level 3 should be **world writable**, but hard for me to test that, feel free to try editing. (This whole reposiory is discardable, would regenerate from source if it is to be used.

This is under my account for now but if there is interest in this I would move it (possibly to [MathML Refresh](https://mathml-refresh.github.io/) ?) so anyone  the WG had write access to L1 and L2, and this Intro, etc.
